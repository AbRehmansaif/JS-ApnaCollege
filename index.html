        <h2>What is AI</h2>
        <p>AI, or artificial intelligence, refers to the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks can include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, understanding natural language, and even interacting with humans. AI systems can range from simple rule-based algorithms to complex neural networks modeled after the human brain.

        There are various subfields within AI, including machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, and expert systems. Machine learning, in particular, has seen significant advancements in recent years, enabling AI systems to learn from data and improve their performance over time without explicit programming.
            
        Overall, AI technology has the potential to revolutionize numerous industries and aspects of our daily lives, from healthcare and transportation to finance and entertainment.</p>

        <h2 class="dataSci">What is Data Science:</h2>
        <p>Data science is an interdisciplinary field that involves extracting insights and knowledge from structured and unstructured data. It combines elements from statistics, computer science, mathematics, and domain expertise to analyze large datasets and uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can inform decision-making and drive innovation.
            <br>
        The process of data science typically involves several stages:
            <br>
        <b>1. Data Acquisition:</b>  Gathering data from various sources, such as databases, files, APIs, sensors, or web scraping.
            <br>
        <b>2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:</b> This step involves cleaning the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. It may also involve transforming and standardizing the data for analysis.
            <br>
        <b>3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</b> Exploring the data visually and statistically to understand its characteristics, relationships, and potential patterns. This often involves techniques such as data visualization and summary statistics.
            <br>
        <b>4. Feature Engineering:</b> Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve the performance of machine learning models.
            <br>
        <b>5. Modeling:</b> Building predictive or descriptive models using machine learning, statistical, or other analytical techniques. This step involves selecting appropriate algorithms, training the models on the data, and evaluating their performance.
            <br>
        <b>6. Evaluation and Interpretation:</b> Assessing the performance of the models and interpreting the results to extract actionable insights.
            <br>
        <b>7. Deployment:</b> Integrating the insights or models into operational systems or products to drive real-world impact.
            <br>
        Data science is widely used across various industries, including finance, healthcare, marketing, e-commerce, and many others. It plays a crucial role in extracting value from the vast amounts of data generated in today's digital world, enabling organizations to make data-driven decisions and gain a competitive advantage.</p>
